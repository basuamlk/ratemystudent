# ratemystudent
## Purpose
Rate My Student project is designed to give an opportunity for professors to rate their students, so that other professors and people can see before-hand the kind of students that are coming to their class. This can be useful for providing reputation for students who may want to enroll in selective class or program.
## Features
Thereâ€™s an authentication system for teachers to login. We also will have profile creation that the teachers will make for the students. 
There is also a list of students to search from based off when their profiles were created.
